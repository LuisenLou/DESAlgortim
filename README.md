# Symmetric Encryption Program

This Java application implements a symmetric encryption algorithm using the Data Encryption Standard (DES). The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt files through a simple command-line interface.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Users can input a plaintext file, and the application will generate a ciphered output file using DES.
- **Decryption**: Users can decrypt previously encrypted files using the same key.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The program offers a simple menu-driven interface to choose between encryption, decryption, or exiting the application.
- **Key Management**: The encryption and decryption processes use the same generated secret key, ensuring consistency in operations.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Basic knowledge of command-line operations
